- :warning: **_Dropped support for Python 3.3_** :warning:
    - [Python 3.3 is end-of-life as of September 2017](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0398/#lifespan)
    - Should continue to function in 3.3, but compatibility cannot be guaranteed going forward.
- Several methods in the `Course` and `Section` classes relating to assignments and submissions have been deprecated.
    - Comparable methods have been implemented in the `Assignment` and `Submission` classes, as appropriate.
    - The deprecated methods now include a warning in the documentation with reference to the replacement. Additionally, the deprecated methods will raise a `DeprecationWarning`.
    - These methods will be removed in a future release.
- `Course.list_sections()` has been deprecated. Use `Course.get_sections()` instead.

### Bugfixes

- Fixed an issue where booleans would be capitalized when sent to Canvas, causing Canvas to misinterpret them and set default values.

### General

- For many endpoints that accept an "object id", either a CanvasAPI Object or integer ID can now be passed. (Thanks, [@a-goetz](https://github.com/a-goetz))
- Added a requester cache that remembers the last 5 requests to Canvas. It can be accessed as the attribute `_cache` of the `requester object`. (e.g. `course._requester._cache`)
- Files can now be downloaded directly from the `File` object in one of two ways: (Thanks, [@DanBrink91](https://github.com/DanBrink91))
    1. `get_contents` will directly return the contents of the file. (e.g. `file.get_contents()`)
    2. `download` will download the file and save it to the provided path. (e.g. `file.download('example.txt')`)
- Moved several methods exclusive to the API Key owner's user from the `User` class to a new class called `CurrentUser`. There is a new method in the `Canvas` class called `get_current_user` to access this object. (e.g. `canvas.get_current_user()`) (Thanks, [@DanBrink91](https://github.com/DanBrink91))

### Bugfixes

- Fixed a bug where creating conversations wouldn't work until the user iterated over the response.
- Lots of formatting fixes and spelling corrections.

### Deprecation Warning

Including `/api/v1/` at the end of the API URL passed to a new `Canvas` object is now deprecated. Users should now only pass the root URL into the `Canvas` object (e.g. `"https://example.com/api/v1/"` should now be `"https://example.com"`).

For now, users including `/api/v1/` will see a `DeprecationWarning`, but things will otherwise operate normally. The ability to continue using `/api/v1/` will be removed in a future release.

## [0.7.0] - 2017-10-04
