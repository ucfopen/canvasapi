# CanvasAPI

CanvasAPI is a Python library for accessing Instructure’s [Canvas LMS API](https://canvas.instructure.com/doc/api/index.html). The library enables developers to programmatically manage Canvas courses, users, gradebooks, and more.

## Installation

You can install CanvasAPI with pip:

`pip install canvasapi`

## Documentation

Full documentation is available at [Read the Docs](http://canvasapi.readthedocs.io/).

## Quickstart

Getting started with CanvasAPI is easy.

Like most API clients, CanvasAPI exposes a single class that provides access to the rest of the API: `Canvas`.

The first thing to do is instantiate a new `Canvas` object by providing your Canvas instance’s root API URL and a valid API key:

```python
# Import the Canvas class
from canvasapi import Canvas

# Canvas API URL
API_URL = "https://example.com"
# Canvas API key
API_KEY = "p@$$w0rd"

# Initialize a new Canvas object
canvas = Canvas(API_URL, API_KEY)
```

You can now use `canvas` to begin making API calls.

### Working with Canvas Objects

CanvasAPI converts the JSON responses from the Canvas API into Python objects. These objects provide further access to the Canvas API. You can find a full breakdown of the methods these classes provide in our [class documentation](http://canvasapi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/class-reference.html). Below, you’ll find a few examples of common CanvasAPI use cases.

#### Course objects

Courses can be retrieved from the API:

```python
# Grab course 123456
>>> course = canvas.get_course(123456)

# Access the course's name
>>> course.name
'Test Course'

# Update the course's name
>>> course.update(course={'name': 'New Course Name'})
```

See our documentation on [keyword arguments](#keyword-arguments) for more information about how `course.update()` handles the `name` argument.

#### User objects

Individual users can be pulled from the API as well:

```python
# Grab user 123
>>> user = canvas.get_user(123)

# Access the user's name
>>> user.name
'Test User'

# Retrieve a list of courses the user is enrolled in
>>> courses = user.get_courses()

# Grab a different user by their SIS ID
>>> login_id_user = canvas.get_user('some_user', 'sis_login_id')
```

#### Paginated Lists

Some calls, like the `user.get_courses()` call above, will request multiple objects from Canvas’s API. CanvasAPI collects these objects in a `PaginatedList` object. `PaginatedList` generally acts like a regular Python list. You can grab an element by index, iterate over it, and take a slice of it.

**Warning**: `PaginatedList` lazily loads its elements. Unfortunately, there’s no way to determine the exact number of records Canvas will return without traversing the list fully. This means that `PaginatedList` isn’t aware of its own length and negative indexing is not currently supported.

Let’s look at how we can use the `PaginatedList` returned by our `get_courses()` call:

```python
# Retrieve a list of courses the user is enrolled in
>>> courses = user.get_courses()

>>> print(courses)
<PaginatedList of type Course>

# Access the first element in our list.
#
# You'll notice the first call takes a moment, but the next N-1
# elements (where N = the per_page argument supplied; the default is 10)
# will be instantly accessible.
>>> print(courses[0])
TST101 Test Course (1234567)

# Iterate over our course list
>>> for course in courses:
         print(course)

TST101 Test Course 1 (1234567)
TST102 Test Course 2 (1234568)
TST103 Test Course 3 (1234569)

# Take a slice of our course list
>>> courses[:2]
[TST101 Test Course 1 (1234567), TST102 Test Course 2 (1234568)]
```

#### Keyword arguments

Most of Canvas’s API endpoints accept a variety of arguments. CanvasAPI allows developers to insert keyword arguments when making calls to endpoints that accept arguments.

```python
# Get all of the active courses a user is currently enrolled in
>>> courses = user.get_courses(enrollment_state='active')


# Fetch 50 objects per page when making calls that return a PaginatedList
>>> courses = user.get_courses(per_page=50)
```

For a more detailed description of how CanvasAPI handles more complex keyword arguments, check out the [Keyword Argument Documentation](http://canvasapi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/keyword-args.html).
